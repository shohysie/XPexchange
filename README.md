For BGEET that integrates more campaigns, a single-class character may reach level cap early and be looking lonely at their teammates leveling up in the later stage. This MOD provides opportunity to exchange superfluous experience points for more abilities.
When any teammate has enough experience points, cast Wish or Limited Wish Spell and new trading options will appear. However, there are some limits:
	1. The character must be with single-class (Component 2 removes this restriction);
	2. The character must have more than 1 million experience points (1.5 or 2.5 million for Legacy of Bhaal mode, decided by EXP cap);

For the following exchange lists, 1.5 or 2.5 times of experience points are required for Legacy of Bhaal mode, decided by EXP cap.
